# HIS
Hospital Information Systems (HIS) refers to the component of health informatics that places focus largely on the administrative, financial, and clinical needs of hospitals.  These systems augment the ability of healthcare professionals to coordinate care by providing a patient’s health information and visit history at the place and time that it is required. So basically, HIS is designed to manage patients and their related information in a centralised way via electronic data processing and predict health status within the hospital environment. No doubt, it has as its aim to provide better healthcare service with precision accuracy.
